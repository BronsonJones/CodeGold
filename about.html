        <div class="WhatIsFBLApara"><p><img src="images/FBLAAcronym.png">FBLA is a national organization. 
            FBLA stands for Future Business Leaders of America. This acronym very 
            accurately describes the goal that the organization is trying to accomplish. 
            Creating and supporting the leaders of tomorrow is a very ambitious and 
            overwhelming goal, however, FBLA has took the stand and already did so. 
            Any member of FBLA will tell you that they have learned invaluable skills 
            from participating with their local chapter.</p></div>
        <div class="WhatIsFBLAh2"><h2>What are the goals that FBLA wants to accomplish?</h2></div>
        <div class="FBLAGoalspara"><p><img src="images/FBLAlock.jpeg">There are many different goals that the FBLA organization
            wants to accomplish. Among these are: strengthening the confidence of students in themselves 
            and their work, creating more interest in and understanding of American business enterprise, and 
            assisting students in the establishment of occupational goals. However, possibly, the most
            sought after goals in FBLA is the development of competent, aggressive business leaders.
